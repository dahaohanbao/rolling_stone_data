DSCI 522 milestone2 for FANG YANG (fyang95)

## Project set-up

- You **must** include the URL to your project's repo in your `milestone2` repo's `README.md` file so we know where to find it.

[milestone_url](https://github.com/dahaohanbao/rolling_stone_data)

- Create a release on your project repo named v2.0 and submit that URL in your `milestone1` repo's `README.md` file so we know where to find it.

This project is to analyze the music genres via year. My dataset is rolling-stone-s-500-greatest-albums-of-all-time. I want to see whether rolling stone release different music genre albums at different age. All the data is in the data folder. The scripts in src folder do the coding part to analyze the data and export result in results folder.

People should first run the cookiecutter.sh to construct the structure of our root folder and run firstscript.r, secondscript.r, thirdscript.r and finaly generalstory.rmd to compelet the project.




## Identify dataset, question, hypothesis and plan of action

1. Choose a public dataset from the web that you are interested in to carry out a small data analysis. You may also use any dataset we have previously worked with in MDS.

>I choose a rolling stone dataset from kaggle.

2. With that dataset, identify a question you would like to ask from it that could be answered by some simple analysis and visualization (e.g., using the Titanic dataset, one might ask if gender played a role in survivorship?)


>What are music genres that rolling stone release at different age?


3. Generate a hypothesis for your question (*e.g.*, using the Titanic dataset, a hypothesis could be that more women survived than men because preference was given to women and children).

>Rolling stone releases the same music genres at different age.

4. Suggest how you might summarize the data to show this as a table or a number, as well as how you might show this as a visualization.

>I'll group the dataset by genres and age. I'll compare the count of songs for music genres in different age.
