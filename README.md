## Analysis on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time


Fang Yang, Dec 2017


## Summary

This project is to analyze the music genres via year. My dataset is rolling-stone-s-500-greatest-albums-of-all-time `data/albumslist.csv`. I want to see what music genres did rolling stone release at different age. All the data is in the `data` folder. The scripts in `src` folder do the coding part to analyze the data and export results tables and plots in `results` folder.

People should firstly run the `src/cookiecutter.sh` to construct the structure of our root folder and run `make all` and finaly generalstory.rmd to compelet the project.

## Hypothesis

Rolling Stone released almost same music genre albums at different age.
